                            <h3>What is smokeless coal?</h3>
                            <p>
                                This is the type of charcoal that is often used
                                with other types of picnic grills or family BBQ
                                grills, eateries, and restaurants on the market
                                today. These are clean coals that are applied
                                science and technology in production, in order
                                to limit and eliminate most of the smoke during
                                use.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Features of smokeless coal</h3>
                            <p>
                                Unlike traditional charcoal, which often has a
                                rough shape, large and small, of a tree.
                                Smokeless charcoal can be freely shaped into
                                blocks that are optimal for transport and
                                storage. Shaped to high compression, smokeless
                                charcoal is heavier in weight and denser than
                                charcoal. Therefore, smokeless coal also gives a
                                longer, more economical burning time and does
                                not explode or splash during combustion.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Smokeless coal uses science and technology in
                                coal production to minimize the smoke generated
                                during coal burning. Unlike the black charcoal
                                used from the past to now, when it comes to
                                coal, there is smoke when burning. Smoke
                                generated from charcoal when burning will
                                produce sulfur and CO, which are harmful to the
                                health of the user and people around. Smokeless
                                charcoal helps food not to be absorbed by toxic
                                gases, especially sulfur gas, which affects
                                health.

                                    the stove to fit. Charcoal does not explode,
                                    does not spark when priming thanks to the
                                    dense and tight inner material density.

                                This pressed charcoal product is mostly used
                                from the raw materials of sawdust, coconut
                                shells. But because the size of coal is not
                                qualified, coal factories take advantage of it
                                to repress members with round, square or
                                chrysanthemum shapes.

                            <p>
                                Sawdust charcoal is produced from 100% natural
                                sawdust. This material source is a waste product
                                of the wood processing industry. Manufacturers
                                will collect at craft villages, workshops,
                                sawmills, lathe industrial or handicraft wood.
                                Sawdust after collection will be compressed into
                                uniform bars in size, then burned into coal and
                                left to cool. The product of red-burned coal is
                                the last stage, so it is not mixed with
                                impurities, high carbon content, fixed at
                                85-88%.

                            <p>
                                Bichotan white coal has hard and long-lasting
                                properties. Besides, when burned, Binchotan
                                charcoal gives off the smell of baked goods, so
                                it is very popular with chefs. Thanks to the
                                structure with an extremely large number of
                                pores, Binchotan charcoal has the ability to
                                absorb chemicals in water, remove toxins in the
                                skin, balance air humidity, and eliminate odors
                                in the refrigerator. Not only that, Bichotan
                                charcoal also increases blood circulation to the
                                body when put in a hot bath, increases the
                                fertility of the soil and balances negative ions
                                in the house. Binchotan charcoal is many times
                                harder than regular charcoal, when knocking 2
                                coals together, there will be a metallic sound.
